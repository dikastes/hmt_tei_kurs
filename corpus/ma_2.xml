                    I have a grand chance
                    <lb/>
                    of writing to you, which may not come again.
                    <lb/>
                    Though I went out today, obtaining various

                    and throat. I only sallied forth because
                    <lb/>
                    I felt a delay in such matters may make
                    <lb/>
                    a great bore afterward (though you can't be blamed). Sometimes I'd better

                    have stayed at home, luckily I
                    <lb/>
                    met my beloved music master on the
                    <lb/>
                    stairs, and told him that practicing made me
                    <lb/>
                    congh so horribly that he mustn't ex-
                    <lb/>
                    pect anything of me. It's also lucky
                    <lb/>
                    that I got a good name for industry
                    <lb/>
                    in two things (I told you in one of my previous
                    <lb/>

                    <lb/>
                    needn't trouble myself. So, as I am
