                    certainly would not have been. I now

                    <lb/>
                    to see people. For, as the Doctor says,

                    May come in - you don't excite me at all.
                    <lb/>
                    I said to another, 'You mayn't come in

                    easily. I take about 1/4 of an hour

                    unlike her — and quite good on

                    level ground! Oh, Mother, I
                    <lb/>
                    hope the rules may be a little
                    <lb/>
                    relaxed! But the worst of it is
                    <lb/>
                    I have promised my dear foreman Doctor,
                    <pb/>
                    on my word of honor, signed a
                    <lb/>
                    paper to that effect, which I must
                    <lb/>
                    show you when I get home. And unless
                    <lb/>
                    he absolves me, I fear I can't. But
                    <lb/>
                    we will see, and I will hope on. Other-
